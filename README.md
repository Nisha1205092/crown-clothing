  
This is a full-stack **MERN** app. 
You can see different branches. 
This project is gradually improved using more advanced topics, e.g., this was initially built with **Context API**. Then it was migrated over to **Redux-Saga**. This project was also initially written using **Javascript**, *SASS*. Then it was updated with **Styled-Components** and **Typescript**. It might look simple but it is made following the best **coding practices** and keeping in mind **scalability**.
