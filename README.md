This project is created for the learning purpose of different concepts and **React**. 
You can see different branches. 
This project has been gradually improved using more advanced topics, e.g., this was initially built with **context api**. Then it was migrated over to **redux-saga**. This project was also initially written using **javascript**, *sass*. Then it was updated with **CSSinJS** and **Typescript**. It might look simple but it is made following the best **coding practices** and keeping in mind **scalability**.
